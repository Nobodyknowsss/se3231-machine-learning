Why did you choose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because I am a gamer and wanted to see if playing games
affects academic performance. By analyzing grades alongside gaming habits, 
I can understand if there’s a connection between how often someone plays and 
their school performance. It’s interesting to explore whether gaming has a positive,
negative, or no effect on grades.

What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

After performing linear regression, I found that some gaming factors have a 
slight impact on grades, but others do not. Playing hours and playing often seem 
to have a small negative effect, meaning more gaming might lead to lower grades. However, 
other factors like parent revenue and education levels also contribute significantly to grades.
This suggests that while gaming habits matter, they are not the only factor. Socioeconomic
background, parental influence, and personal study habits play a larger role. Overall,
the results show that gaming alone does not determine academic success, but balancing 
 study and play is essential.

How relevant is linear regression today?

Linear regression is still widely used today in many fields. 
It helps analyze relationships between variables, making it useful in education, business, 
healthcare, and research. Despite more advanced machine learning models, linear regression
remains a simple and effective tool for making predictions and understanding trends in data.
